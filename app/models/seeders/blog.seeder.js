Deputy Attorney General Imran Ahmed Bhuiyan said today that he refrained from signing a statement, being prepared by the attorney general's office, protesting the recent letter from global figures to the prime minister over trial proceedings against Nobel Laureate Prof Muhammad Yunus.

"I support the statement issued by the Nobel Laureates and world leaders about the trial proceedings against Muhammad Yunus as I think that he is being harassed," the deputy attorney general said.
</p>
<p>
The attorney general's office is collecting signatures from the attorney general, additional attorney generals, deputy attorney generals and assistant attorney generals in order to issue a statement in protest against the statement, he said.
